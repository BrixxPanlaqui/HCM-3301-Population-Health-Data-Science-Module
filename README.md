This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's Center for Applied Data Science (CADS) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions.

# Population Health
This respository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of a course in Population Health as taught by Dr. Jiangmin Xu.

Students will learn how health outcomes are assessed and examine health issues from a population health perspective. In addition, students will examine how entities such as healthcare deliviery systems, public health agencies, and community-based organizations work in tandem to develop interventions for improving health outcomes across all communities. As a data science learning outcome,
